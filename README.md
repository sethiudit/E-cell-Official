# ************************Ecell IITP Website**********************
The project includes the official website of Ecell IIT Patna. My major contribution was helping the 'tech and dev' team of Ecell during the planning, improving design, and updating the website from time to time. The website contains various pages, including components of the website. The major work by our team was done via HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.
<br>
Whenever any event was organized by Ecell, the information and required components were displayed on the website by our team.<br>
